README for packagecheck.pl
---

packagecheck.pl is a perl script used inside the debian-perl group for checking packages
maintained by that group. As a consequence, it is very debian-perl centric,
and certain assumptions are made, like that you have the debian-perl svn repository
checked out.

Caveat Emptor: The script might not be of much use outside the debian-perl group.
But you are welcome to use whatever code you find useful here.
